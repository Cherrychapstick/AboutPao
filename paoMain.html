          From a young age I’ve had a strong interest in technology. In High School I was a gaming concepts major where I learned the basics of game development, and basic coding skills.  In the summer of 2018 I enrolled in a summer program called Everyone Can Code (ECC) where my team and I were tasked with developing an app that targeted an issue within our community. None of us had any previous app development experience and the time constraint of 2 weeks put us under a lot of stress. Under pressure I decided I needed to step up in my group to help us make it to a city-wide competition. We didn’t anticipate the success that came from our app. We presented our app, Close Call at the Apple Michigan avenue retail store to an audience of 300+ and later to mayor Rham Emmanuel and President Obama. Because of my hard work and efforts I was given the opportunity to be a part of ECC’s Advanced Training cohort the following summer. With the help of my instructors I was able to coach my new team of 4 into building an app prototype for the City of Chicago.  It was clear to me then that a path in technology was worth pursuing.

          Today I live as a woman who has overcome various hardships. I’ve pushed myself through every obstacle to continue to find light in dark situations. I enjoy pushing the boundaries of my creativity, and I love to learn things outside of whats being shown around me. This is just a small capsule of words and images I have gathered and created in the best and worst moments of my career. Today they sit as reminders of the beauty my eyes can gloss over through the chaos. It might not make sense to many but after all it was created for me.
